# Abstract

&ensp;&ensp; Untargeted mass spectrometry is a robust tool for biological
research, but researchers universally time consumed by dataset parsing.  We
developed MCnebula, a novel visualization strategy proposed with
multidimensional view, termed multi-chemical nebulae, involving in scope of
abundant classes, classification, structures, sub-structural characteristics
and fragmentation similarity.  Many state-of-the-art technologies and popular
methods were incorporated in MCnebula workflow to boost chemical discovery.
Notably, MCnebula can be applied to explore classification and structural
characteristics of unknown compounds that beyond the limitation of spectral
library.  MCnebula was integrated in R package and public available for custom
R statistical pipeline analysis.  Now, MCnebula2 (R object-oriented programming
with S4 system) is further available for more friendly applications.

# Introduction

&ensp;&ensp; 
We know that the analysis of untargeted LC-MS/MS dataset generally begin with
feature detection.  It detects 'peaks' as features in MS^1^ data.  Each feature
may represents a compound, and assigned with MS^2^ spectra.  The MS^2^ spectra
was used to find out the compound identity.  The difficulty lies in annotating
these features to discover their compound identity, mining out meaningful
information, so as to serve further biological research.  Herein, a classified
visualization method, called MCnebula, was used for addressing this difficulty.
MCnebula utilizes the state-of-the-art computer prediction technology, SIRIUS
workflow (SIRIUS, ZODIAC, CSI:fingerID, CANOPUS)[@duhrkop_sirius_2019; @bocker_sirius_2009; @duhrkop_searching_2015; @ludwig_database-independent_2020; @duhrkop_systematic_2021], for compound
formula prediction, structure retrieve and classification prediction.  MCnebula
integrates an abundance-based classes (ABC) selection algorithm into features
annotation: depending on the user, MCnebula focuses chemical classes with more
or less features in the dataset (the abundance of classes), visualizes them,
and displays the features they involved; these classes can be dominant
structural classes or sub-structural classes.  With MCnebula, we can switch
from untargeted to targeted analysis, focusing precisely on the compound or
chemical class of interest to the researcher.  

# Set-up

&ensp;&ensp; Load the R package used for analysis.  In the following analysis
process, to illustrate the source of the function, we use the symbol `::` to
mark the functions, e.g., `dplyr::filter`.  The functions that were not marked
may source from MCnebula2 or the packages that R (version 4.2) loaded by
default.  


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(MCnebula2)
library(exMCnebula2)
```


# Integrate data and Create Nebulae
## Initialize analysis
Set SIRIUS project path and its version to initialize mcnebula object.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
mcn <- mcnebula()
mcn <- initialize_mcnebula(mcn, "sirius.v5", ".")
ion_mode(mcn) <- "pos"
```


Create a temporary folder to store the output data.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
tmp <- paste0("temp_data")
dir.create(tmp, F)
export_path(mcn) <- tmp
```


## Filter candidates
&ensp;&ensp; Suppose we predicted a potential compound represented by LC-MS/MS
spectrum, and obtained the candidates of chemical molecular formula, structure
and chemical class. These candidates include both positive and negative
results: for chemical molecular formula and chemical structure, the positive
prediction was unique; for chemical class, multiple positive predictions that
belong to various classification were involved.  We did not know the exact
negative and positive.  Normally, we ranked and filtered these according to the
scores.  There were numerious scores, for isotopes, for mass error, for
structural similarity, for chemical classes...  Which score selected to rank
candidates depends on the purpose of research. Such as:

- To find out the chemical structure mostly be positive, ranking the candidates
  by structural score.
- To determine whether the potential compound may be of a certain chemical
  classes, ranking the candidates by the classified score.

Ether by `filter_formula()`, `filter_structure()` or `filter_ppcp()`, the
candidate with top score can be obtained.  However, for the three module
(formula, structure, classes), sometimes thier top score candidates were not in
line with each other.  That is, thier top score towards different chemical
molecular formulas.  To find out the corresponding data in other modules,
`create_reference()` should be performed to establish the 'specific_candidate'
for subsequent filtering.  


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
mcn <- filter_structure(mcn)
mcn <- create_reference(mcn)
mcn <- filter_formula(mcn, by_reference = T)
```


## Filter chemical classes
&ensp;&ensp; The PPCP (Posterior Probability of Classification Prediction) data
for each 'feature' contains the prediction of thousands of classes for the
  potential compound (even if the chemical structure was unknown).  See
  <http://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0740-8> for details about the
  prediction.  The data contains attributes of:

- `class.name`: name of classes.
- `pp.value`: value of posterior probability.  `hierarchy`: hierarchy of
  classes in the taxonomy.  See
  <https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-016-0174-y> for
  details about hierarchy and taxonomy of chemical classification.
- ...

The method `create_stardust_classes()` use these inner attributes to filter
classes candidates for each 'feature'.

Compared to the chemical class filtering within PPCP data by
`create_stardust_classes()`, the filtering within 'stardust_classes' data by
`cross_filter_stardust()` is fundamentally different.

- For `create_stardust_classes()`, the PPCP data belongs to each 'feature'.
  When performing the filtering, only simple threshold conditions or absolute
  conditions are set to filter the chemical classes; there is no crossover
  between the different attributes and no crossover between the 'features'.
  Therefore, we consider this as 'inner' filtering.
- For `cross_filter_stardust()`, the data of the chemical classes and their
  classified 'features', i.e.  'stardust_classes' data, were combined and then
  grouped upon the chemical classes.  After grouping, each chemical class has a
  certain quantity of "features".  When filtering, statistics may be performed
  on 'features' data within a group; statistics may be performed on these data
  in conjunction with 'features_annotation' data; and statistics may be
  performed to compare groups with each other.  As its crossover, we consider
  this as 'cross' filtering.

Use `help(cross_filter_stardust)` to get more details about the algorithm.


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
mcn <- create_stardust_classes(mcn)
mcn <- create_features_annotation(mcn)
mcn <- cross_filter_stardust(mcn, min_number = 30, max_ratio = 0.07)
classes <- unique(stardust_classes(mcn)$class.name)
table.filtered.classes <- backtrack_stardust(mcn)
```


Manually filter some repetitive classes or sub-structural classes.
By means of Regex matching, we obtained a number of recurring
name of chemical classes that would contain manay identical compounds
as their sub-structure.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
classes
pattern <- c(
  "stero", "fatty acid", "pyr", "hydroxy", "^Ar",
  "^Alk", "^Ben", "^orga", "^Carbo"
)
dis <- unlist(lapply(pattern, grep, x = classes, ignore.case = T))
dis <- classes[dis]
dis
dis <- dis[-1]
```


Remove these classes.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
mcn <- backtrack_stardust(mcn, dis, remove = T)
```


## Create Nebulae
Create Nebula-Index data. This data created based on 'stardust_classes' data.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
mcn <- create_nebula_index(mcn)
```


&ensp;&ensp; Whether it is all filtered by the algorithm provided by
MCnebula2's function or custom filtered for some chemical classes, we now have
a data called 'nebula_index'.  This data records a number of chemical classes
and the 'features' attributed to them.  The subsequent analysis process or
visualization will be based on it.  Each chemical class is considered as a
'nebula' and its classified 'features' are the components of these 'nebulae'.
In the visualization, these 'nebulae' will be visualized as networks. Formally,
we call these 'nebulae' formed on the basis of 'nebula_index' data as
Child-Nebulae. In comparison, when we put all the 'features' together to form a
large network, then this 'nebula' is called Parent-Nebulae.


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
mcn <- compute_spectral_similarity(mcn)
mcn <- create_parent_nebula(mcn)
mcn <- create_child_nebulae(mcn)
```


Create layouts for Parent-Nebula or Child-Nebulae visualizations.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
mcn <- create_parent_layout(mcn)
mcn <- create_child_layouts(mcn)
mcn <- activate_nebulae(mcn)
```


The available chemical classes for visualization and its
sequence in storage.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
table.nebulae <- visualize(mcn)
table.nebulae
```


Draw and save as .png or .pdf image files.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
fig.s <- 1.5
p <- visualize(mcn, "parent")
ggsave(f5.61 <- paste0(tmp, "/parent_nebula.png"), p)
pdf(f5.62 <- paste0(tmp, "/child_nebula.pdf"), 12 * fig.s, 14 *
  fig.s)
visualize_all(mcn)
dev.off()
```


```{r parent, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Parent-Nebula'}
knitr::include_graphics("temp_data/parent_nebula.png")
```

```{r child, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Child-Nebulae'}
knitr::include_graphics("temp_data/child_nebula.pdf")
```

In general, Parent-Nebulae
(Fig. \@ref(fig:parent))
is too informative to show, so Child-Nebulae
(Fig. \@ref(fig:child))
was used to dipict the abundant classes of features (metabolites)
in a grid panel, intuitively. In a bird's eye view of
Child-Nebulae, we can obtain many characteristics of features,
involving classes distribution, structure identified accuracy, as
well as spectral similarity within classes.

# Nebulae for Downstream analysis
## Statistic analysis
Next we perform a statistical analysis with quantification data of the
features. Note that the SIRIUS project does not contain quantification
data of features, so our object `mcn` naturally does not contain
that either. We need to get it from elsewhere.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
origin <- data.table::fread("features.csv")
origin <- tibble::as_tibble(origin)
```


Now, let's check the columns in the table.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
origin
```


Remove the rest of the columns and keep only the columns for ID,
m/z, retention time, and quantification.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
quant <- dplyr::select(origin, id = 1, dplyr::contains("Peak area"))
colnames(quant) <- gsub("\\.mzML Peak area", "", colnames(quant))
quant <- dplyr::mutate(quant, .features_id = as.character(id))
```


Create the metadata table and store it in the `mcn` object
along with the quantification data.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
gp <- c(
  Control = "^B", Model = "^M", QC = "^QC", Pos = "^POS",
  Treat_low = "^CL", Treat_medium = "^CM", Treat_high = "^CH"
)
metadata <- MCnebula2:::group_strings(colnames(quant), gp, "sample")
features_quantification(mcn) <- dplyr::select(quant, -id)
sample_metadata(mcn) <- metadata
```


&ensp;&ensp; Variance analysis was used as a way to detect whether there were
differences between the experimental and control groups and whether the
differences were significant. Linear models are an effective tool for variance
analysis, and it permit very general analyses. The 'limma' package
[@gentleman_limma_2005] integrates a number of functions for creating linear
models and regression analysis. The statistical analysis provided in MCnebula2
is mainly built around the functions in the 'limma' package.  

In the following we use the
`binary_comparison` function for variance analysis.
To accommodate the downstream analysis of gene
expression that the `limma` package was originally used for, we
should log2-transform and centralize this data
(use the default parameter 'fun_norm' of `binary_comparison()`).

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
mcn <- binary_comparison(mcn, Model - Control, Pos - Model, Treat_high -
  Model, Treat_medium - Model, Treat_low - Model)
top.list <- top_table(statistic_set(mcn))
```


Check the results.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
top.list[1]
```


## Set tracer in Child-Nebulae
&ensp;&ensp; Tracking top features obtained by Variance analysis in Nebulae
provides insight not only into the chemical classes of these top features, but
also into other features (may be analogous metabolites). Other features are not
among the top ranked features, but they may contain key features that were
missed due to algorithmic specificity. By tracking top features, it is possible
to revisit all features at the overall data level.


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
n <- 50
tops <- select_features(mcn,
  tani.score_cutoff = 0.5, order_by_coef = 1,
  coef = 1, togather = T
)
top20 <- tops[1:n]
palette_set(melody(mcn)) <- colorRampPalette(palette_set(mcn))(n)
mcn2 <- set_tracer(mcn, top20)
mcn2 <- create_child_nebulae(mcn2)
mcn2 <- create_child_layouts(mcn2)
mcn2 <- activate_nebulae(mcn2)
mcn2 <- set_nodes_color(mcn2, use_tracer = T)
```


Draw and save the image.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
pdf(
  f8.2 <- paste0(tmp, "/tracer_child_nebula.pdf"), 12 * 1.2,
  14 * 1.2
)
visualize_all(mcn2)
dev.off()
```


```{r tracer, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Tracing top features in Child-Nebulae'}
knitr::include_graphics("temp_data/tracer_child_nebula.pdf")
```

A part of the top features are marked with colored nodes in
Child-Nebulae
(Fig. \@ref(fig:tracer)).

Tops in classes: 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
showTops <- select_features(mcn,
  tani.score_cutoff = 0.5, order_by_coef = 1,
  coef = 1,
)
showTops
```


## Set tracer in Child-Nebulae (customize the top Features)
Use custom defined Features to perform tracing mode of Child-Nebulae.
The table was from:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
tb <- openxlsx::read.xlsx("../manual_id.xlsx")
topsM <- tb[[2]]
topsM <- as.character(topsM[!is.na(topsM)])
```


Similar to above section:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
mcn2 <- set_tracer(mcn, topsM)
mcn2 <- create_child_nebulae(mcn2)
mcn2 <- create_child_layouts(mcn2)
mcn2 <- activate_nebulae(mcn2)
mcn2 <- set_nodes_color(mcn2, use_tracer = T)
```


Draw and save the image.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
pdf(f9.3 <- paste0(tmp, "/tracer_child_nebula_manual.pdf"), 12 *
  1.2, 14 * 1.2)
visualize_all(mcn2)
dev.off()
```


## Annotate Nebulae
Now, the available Nebulae contains:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
table.nebulae2 <- visualize(mcn2)
table.nebulae2
```


Next, let us focus on Indoles and derivatives

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
mcn2 <- set_nodes_color(mcn2, use_tracer = T)
colTreat <- colorRampPalette(c("lightblue", "blue"))(5)[1:3]
palette_stat(melody(mcn2)) <- c(
  Control = "#B6DFB6", Model = "grey70",
  QC = "white", Pos = "lightyellow", Treat_low = colTreat[1],
  Treat_medium = colTreat[2], Treat_high = colTreat[3]
)
indo <- "Indoles and derivatives"
mcn2 <- annotate_nebula(mcn2, indo)
```


Draw and save the image.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
p <- visualize(mcn2, indo, annotate = T)
ggsave(f10.3 <- paste0(tmp, "/indo_child.pdf"), p, height = 5)
```


```{r indo, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Annotated Nebulae: Indoles and derivatives'}
knitr::include_graphics("temp_data/indo_child.pdf")
```

## Export for Cytoscape
Export Child-Nebula of `indo` and others as '.graphml'.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
res <- igraph(child_nebulae(mcn2))
lapply(names(res), function(name) {
  igraph::write_graph(res[[name]], file = paste0(
    tmp, "/",
    name, ".graphml"
  ), format = "graphml")
})
```


```{r indoCyto, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Annotated Nebulae: Indoles and derivatives', fig.width = 7}
knitr::include_graphics("screenCap_Indo.png")
```

# Session infomation
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
sessionInfo()
```
