3. Expansion effect of romiplostim on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells versus other thrombopoietin receptor agonists
(Submitter supplied) Romiplostim, a thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist, is a clinically approved drug that is clearly effective in reconstituting hematopoiesis in refractory aplastic anemia and　idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. However, the mechanism underlying its biological effect is unknown, and its difference with other TPO receptor agonists remains unclear. Therefore, we determined the in vitro expansion effect of romiplostim on human CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) versus recombinant human TPO (rhTPO) and another clinically available drug eltrombopag. more...

4. The methylome of buccal epithelial cells is influenced by age, sex, and physiological properties
(Submitter supplied) Epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA methylation, have emerged as regulators of gene expression and are implicated in various biological processes and disease states. Understanding the factors influencing the epigenome is essential for unravelling its complexity. In this study, we aimed to identify how the methylome of buccal epithelial cells, a non-invasive and easily accessible tissue, is associated with demographic and health-related variables commonly used in clinical settings, such as age, sex, blood immune composition, hemoglobin levels, and others. more...

5. Oligoclonal T-cell expansion in a patient with bone marrow failure after CD19 CAR-T for Richter transformed DLBCL
(Submitter supplied) Background and methods: CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy (CAR-T) has emerged as a promising treatment modality for multiple B-cell malignancies. However, its utility is hampered by a unique toxicity profile that classically includes cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. Hematological toxicity represents a vexing and common side effect. Cytopenia can occur long after lymphodepleting chemotherapy and resolution of CRS and is often prolonged and biphasic in nature. more...

6. Blocking common gamma chain cytokine signaling ameliorates T-cell-mediated pathogenesis in disease models
(Submitter supplied) The common γ chain (γc; IL2RG) is a subunit of the interleukin (IL) receptors for the γc cytokines IL2, IL4, IL7, IL9, IL15, and IL21. Because of the lack of appropriate neutralizing antibodies recognizing IL2RG, it has been difficult to thoroughly interrogate the role of γc cytokines in inflammatory and autoimmune disease settings. To determine whether γc cytokines might be targeted for T-cell-mediated disease prevention and treatment, we generated a new γc cytokine receptor antibody, REGN7257. more...

7. Transcriptome analysis of HLA-DR(+) HSPCs and HLA-DR(-) HSPCs in aplastic anemia patients
(Submitter supplied) HLA-DR-lacking HSPCs [HLA-DR(-) HSPCs] were detected in aplastic anemia (AA) patients with HLA-DR15. HLA-DR(-) HSPCs may evade the attack by CD4+ T-cells recognizing the autoantigen presented by HLA-DR15. The goal of this study is to clarify  the  immune escape mechanisms from antigen-specific T-cells by comparing the trranscriptome profile of HLA-DR(+) HSPCs and HLA-DR(-) HSPCs.

8. Transcriptome analysis of acute graft-versus-host disease in children
(Submitter supplied) Steroid-refractory gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease (GI GVHD) is a major barrier to successful hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).  Poor understanding of the pathophysiology of GI GVHD contributes to continued poor outcomes and high mortality rates.  We therefore obtained rectosigmoidal mucosal biopsies from post-HSCT patients with GI GVHD and submitted them to RNA-sequencing in order to transcriptomally characterize GI GVHD. more...

12. A surge of DNA damage links transcriptional reprogramming and hematopoietic deficit in Fanconi anemia
(Submitter supplied) Impaired DNA crosslink repair leads to Fanconi anemia (FA), characterized by a unique manifestation of bone marrow failure and pancytopenia among diseases caused by DNA damage response defects. As a germline disorder, why the hematopoietic hierarchy is specifically affected is not fully understood. We find that reprogramming transcription during hematopoietic differentiation results in an overload of genotoxic stress, which causes aborted differentiation and depletion of FA mutant progenitor cells. more...

13. Gene expression - PRDM8 reveals aberrant DNA methylation in aging syndromes and is relevant for hematopoietic and neuronal differentiation.
(Submitter supplied) Dyskeratosis congenita (DKC) and idiopathic aplastic anemia (AA) are bone marrow failure syndromes that share characteristics of premature aging with severe telomere attrition. In this study, we analyzed blood samples of 62 AA and 13 DKC patients to demonstrate that their epigenetic age predictions are overall increased, albeit not directly correlated with telomere length. Aberrant DNA methylation was observed in the gene PRDM8 in DKC and AA as well as in other diseases with premature aging phenotype, such as Down syndrome, Werner syndrome and Hutchinson-Gilford-Progeria syndrome. more...

Using flow cytometry, deep sequencing, and computational methods, we examined the blood of 32 AA patients and 29 appropriate controls for Vβ usage; eight of these patients showing CD8+CD57+ expansion and three healthy subjects were subjected to TCR deep sequencing to confirm the clonality. more...

18. MicroRNA expression data from bone marrow T cells of acquired aplastic anemia patients and healthy individuals
(Submitter supplied) Acquired aplastic anemia (AA) is an immune-mediated disease with active destruction of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells by the cytotoxic T-cells in bone marrow. Aberrant expression of microRNAs in T-cells results in development of some autoimmune diseases.Screening the potential miRNAs which may play regulatory role in T cells of AA is meaningful to explore the mechanism of AA. We used microarrays to screen the differential expression pattern of miRNAs in T cells of aplatic anemia patients to find the potential regulatory miRNAs.

19. DNA Methylation in PRDM8 is a Biomarker for Dyskeratosis Congenita
(Submitter supplied) Dyskeratosis congenita (DKC) is characterized by impaired telomere maintenance and reveals clinical features of premature aging. So far, diagnosis of DKC relies particularly on telomere length screening raising the need for additional biomarkers. In this study, we analysed global DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles of DKC patients. Age-associated DNAm changes were not generally accelerated in DKC. However, we observed significant hypermethylation in the gene for PR domain containing 8 (PRDM8). more...
